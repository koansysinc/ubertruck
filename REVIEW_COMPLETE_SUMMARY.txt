KEY FINDINGS SUMMARY
================================================================================

CURRENT STATE:
  Frontend:  Beautiful React UI (Excellent UX design, 0% API integration)
  Backend:   Comprehensive REST API (40+ endpoints, fully specified, untested)
  Result:    Beautiful UI that can't talk to working API

TOTAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED: 45
  🔴 Critical  (8) - Will crash the app if shipped as-is
  🟠 High      (12) - Will cause feature failures
  🟡 Medium    (15) - Will cause UX/support issues
  🟢 Low       (10) - Performance issues

ROOT CAUSES:
  1. Parallel development without synchronization
  2. Mock-data dependency (hardcoded everything)
  3. No type safety (plain JavaScript, no TypeScript)
  4. Missing error handling (silent failures)
  5. No shared data models (frontend/backend shapes don't match)

BUSINESS IMPACT:
  If shipped as-is:        0 revenue (app crashes)
  Cost of delay per week:  ₹500k+ (lost revenue opportunity)
  Timeline to fix properly: 4-6 weeks, 2-3 developers, 250 hours

REMEDIATION EFFORT:
  Phase 1 (Week 1):     40 hours (Critical fixes)
  Phase 2 (Weeks 2-3):  60 hours (High priority)
  Phase 3 (Week 4):     50 hours (Medium priority)
  Phase 4 (Ongoing):    40 hours (Low priority optimizations)
  ─────────────────────────────
  Total:                250 hours (4-6 weeks)

RESOURCE REQUIREMENT:
  Frontend Developers: 2-3
  Backend Developers:  1
  QA Engineers:        1
  DevOps:              1
  Total:               5-6 people
