## 📊 EFFICIENCY AUDIT FRAMEWORK

### 1. Template Efficiency Score (TES)

```yaml
TES Calculation Formula:
  Overall Score = (
    Reusability × 0.25 +
    Consistency × 0.25 +
    Speed × 0.20 +
    Quality × 0.20 +
    Compliance × 0.10
  )

  Target Score: ≥85%
  Current Score: [Calculated below]
